Have you read the [`basic`](https://github.com/EZaca/zactmpl/tree/master/sample/basic/README.md)?

# Script Tag

Javascript can be written between `<?` and `?>` tags.

All the code between these tags is executed on an isolated context, so, it won't mess with your global or current scope. It is good if you don't trust the code you are executing. It is valid only while building the text through the template. If you execute any script generated by the template, your are by yourself!

The `<? ... ?>` tag does not print anything, and you can't use the `return` keyword in its context, because it is not a function. If you want to print a text, you have two choice:

 - Use its brother tag `<?= ... ?>`;
 - Use the global `print` function;

The `print` function is available in the script context, so you can do something like that:

    <? print("My text"); ?>

It is useful to write more complex scripts:

    <?
        try{
            somePassedFunction();
            print("OK");
        }catch(e)
        {
            print("Failed: "+e.toString());
        }
    ?>

And that's all! See the `sample.js` or run it (`node sample.js`) to see the result. It will print a simple "Hello world" message.
See you!
